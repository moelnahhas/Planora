# Planora 🧠📅

Planora is an AI-enhanced to-do list web application that helps users manage their time more efficiently. Instead of manually planning your day, Planora intelligently turns your task list into a dynamic, editable schedule — personalized to your priorities, availability, and preferences.

## ✨ Key Features
